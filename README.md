## Notes

Some of the files may *NOT* be distributable under the GPL license due to restrictions of the Intel University Program. The author has tried its best to remove such files but omission is unavoidable. **USE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION!**

Notably, the PLL from the IP catalog for generating clock signals is not included.
